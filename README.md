**Overview of the Project:**

**Project:**

Temperature and Humidity Monitoring with DHT-11 Sensor.

**Objective:**

This project interfaces a DHT-11 sensor with an Arduino to measure real-time Temperature and Humidity. Displays the readings on to a 16*2 Liquid Crystal Display.

**Key Activities:**

•	Designing a virtual system.

•	Interfacing the DHT-11 sensor.

•	Interfacing the 16*2 Liquid Crystal Display.

•	Programming the Aduino.

•	Monitoring the Real-Time Temperature and Humidity values.


**Technologies used:**

•	Arduino IDE.

•	Proteus 8 Professional.


**Key Insights:**

•	Designed a virtual system using Proteus software.

•	Arduino UNO is the main control unit of the system.

•	DHT-11 sensor is used to measure the real-time Temperature and Humidity values.

•	16*2 Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) is used to display the readings.

•	Arduino IDE is used to write and debug the code.

•	Once the code is compiled a hex file is created and is used to simulate system in proteus.

**Conclusion:**

This project is demonstration of interfacing a DHT-11 sensor to read and monitor the Real-Time Temperature and Humidity.
